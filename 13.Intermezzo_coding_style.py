# CODING STYLE
# Coding styles are important when you want to write large complex pieces of code
# Some coding styles are just more readable than others
# Most languages can be written in a variety of styles but adopting a more readable style makes your code easy to manage and easy for others to read

# PEP 8
# In Python. PEP 8 is the style guide that most projects use
# According to the documentation, it is a very readable and elegant style
# Some guidelines are as follows:
# 1. Use 4 space indentation and no tabs. This is a good middleground between large indentation and smaller indentation. Large indentation is easier to read and small indentation allows for greater nesting capability
# 2. Wrap lines (break the line into multiple lines) that exceed 79 characters. Makes it easier to view multiple files of code in a split screen fashion and also to read code on smaller displays
# 3. Use blank lines to separate functions and classes and large blocks of code within functions or classes
# 4. Whenever possible, put comments on a line of their own
# 5. Use docstrings
# 6. Leave spaces around operators and after commas e.g print(3 + 5, 'hello')
# 7. Name classes and functions appropriately. Use upper camel casing (LikeThisPlease) for class names and lower snake casing for function names (like_this_please)
# 8. Always use __self__ as the name for first method in a class
# 9. Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.
# 10. Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.
