# Key benefit of Python is that it is  unlike Java/C/C++ where the write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow
# Despite this, Python is a real programming language.

# Python is a HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
# A high level programming language is one with human readable syntax that abstracts the low level details of computer's hardware
# So, Python supports a lot of high level data types (like flexible arrays and dictionaries)

# Python supports MODULAR PROGRAMMING
# i.e it allows you to split your programs into modules in such a way that they can be reused in other programs
# It comes with a lot of built in modules that can be used for various tasks. E.g os module, random module, math module

# Python is also an INTERPRETED language.
# In a compiled language, all code is converted into executable machine code before running in a process called compiling which produces an executable.
# In an interpreted language however, the code is executed line by line
# This might help us have a reduced runtime as there is no need for compilation or linking.
# C is an example of a compiled language

# Another important fact about Python is that it is EXTENSIBLE which means that it is easy to add a new built in function/module if one can write C
# This is due to the fact that Python is written in C
